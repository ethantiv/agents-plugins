#
# Restart the code-review workflow for the current PR branch so a fresh run
# evaluates the latest commit and the current (post-resolve) review-thread state.
#
# Run this after resolving/closing any review thread while a review is still in
# progress: an in-flight run read the pre-resolve snapshot and would re-post
# findings you already handled. It is especially important after a skip-resolve
# with no code change to push, since nothing else re-triggers the review.
#
# Scope / assumptions: the review must be a re-runnable GitHub Actions workflow
# (the claude-code-action convention). It does NOT cover reviews delivered by a
# webhook bot with no Actions run. Repos whose review workflow has a different
# file name pass it explicitly (arg or env), so the script stays repo-agnostic.
#
# Usage: restart-review.sh [WORKFLOW]
#   WORKFLOW — workflow file name or workflow name (e.g. "claude-code-review.yml"
#              or "Claude Code Review"). Precedence: arg > $BABYSIT_REVIEW_WORKFLOW
#              > default "claude-code-review.yml".
#
# Behaviour: if no review is in progress for the current branch, it does nothing
# (exit 0). Otherwise it cancels every in-flight run of that workflow on the
# branch — so none can post stale findings — and reruns the most recent run.
# `gh run rerun` reuses that run's commit; after a push the most recent run is
# the one the push triggered, so it already targets the new HEAD.
